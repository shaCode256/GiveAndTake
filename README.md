# Give And Take 

For Ariel university students/staff that are smartphone users, who want to ask for help or give help to their peers: 

the Give and Take Android application is a sharing social application
that allows users to open and maintain requests, watch open requests of others, and to communicate to offer their help, with an option of filtering based on location, visualization and placing requests on a map, to see for instance whoâ€™s nearby.

Unlike traditional social/map apps sites such as WhatsApp or Google Maps, our product allows users to manage the requests on a targeted system to Ariel students only, enabling wide distribution and location filtering by combining requests management and a map.

## Features:

8) The app enables users to report other users

9) The system requires a university email to register users

10) Admins are able to remove user posts

11) The app enables communication between the users of the application 
    so that they can answer requests

12) The system allows user registration and login according to verified details, which will be saved in the system

13) A user is able to delete his request from the map

13) Managing the requests and viewing them on the map is reliable,
