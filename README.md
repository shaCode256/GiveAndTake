# Give And Take: Android Application
## Shared map-based, users events storage and management
For Ariel university students | staff that are smartphone users, who want to ask for help or give help to their peers: 

the Give and Take Android application is a sharing social application
that allows users to open and maintain requests, watch open requests of others, and to communicate to offer their help, with an option of filtering based on location, visualization and placing requests on a map, to see for instance whoâ€™s nearby.

Unlike traditional social/map apps sites such as WhatsApp or Google Maps, our product allows users to manage the requests on a targeted system to Ariel students only, enabling wide distribution and location filtering by combining requests management and a map.
